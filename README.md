# Line-follower


Introducing the ultimate line following robot - a sleek, advanced machine engineered with precision and style in mind. The robot is built using an Arduino Uno board as the main controller, and is powered by two DC motors and a QTR-8A sensor. These motors are seamlessly connected to a breadboard via wires, providing smooth, efficient movement.

The robot is equipped with lights, complete with resistors, that allow it to navigate in low-light conditions with ease. Additionally, the robot boasts several impressive add-on features such as a spoiler for improved stability, cool rims for a touch of style, and headlights for enhanced visibility.

The robot is equipped with a QTR-8A sensor, which is a crucial component in its ability to follow a line. The sensor works by emitting infrared light and measuring the reflectance of the surface underneath it and it utilizes only 6 of its 8 sensors. This allows the robot to detect the contrast between the line and the surrounding surface. Before the robot begins to follow the line, it goes through a calibration process. During calibration, the robot moves left and right, allowing the sensor to take readings of the surface and determine the location of the line. This way the robot can adjust its position and make sure it is following the line as closely as possible. With the sensor's precise readings and the robot's advanced control system, it can follow the line with great accuracy and stability.

The robot's movement is controlled using a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller, which guarantees precise and accurate movement. With its ability to effortlessly follow a line, this robot is truly in a class of its own.

Also, I am grateful to have had [Petru](https://github.com/petrupetru) as my teammate in "Echipa cu numarul patru" for this hackaton. Together, we accomplished a great deal and I couldn't have done it without his contributions. Our fastest time for the route presented in the demo video was 18.284 seconds
